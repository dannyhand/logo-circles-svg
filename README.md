# Logos inside of circles

## What is this?
logo-circles-svg is a repo of svg code that you can insert into your web page
if you want your visitor to see a circle with a logo inside of it

## But why?
- I wanted [my website](https://moist.biz) to work like a business card of sorts, with links to my profiles elsewhere.
- Little circles take up less space than lots of words.
- Logos are easily recognizable on sight.
